Description: Statistical functional depth based normalization and outlier detection for gene expression data.
    This package is dedicated to two central aspects of gene expression preprocessing: 
    normalization and outlier detection. In this package, those methodologies are based 
    on statistical depth. The outlier detection methodology can be generally applied.
